## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/davidgalfi/Models-of-Complex-Drug-Treatments-for-Viral-Infections.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Models-of-Complex-Drug-Treatments-for-Viral-Infections
    ```

3. Download the **HAL Library** from [HAL setup page](https://halloworld.org/setup.html).

4. Include the HAL library in your project by adding it to your classpath:

    ```bash
    javac -cp "path-to-hal-library.jar" src/Main.java
    ```

5. Ensure you have Java installed. If not, install the latest version [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

## Usage 📈

1. Compile the Java source code with the HAL library:

    ```bash
    javac -cp "path-to-hal-library.jar" src/Main.java
    ```
2. Build the project:
   
   ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
   
4. Run the main simulation:

    ```bash
    java -cp "path-to-hal-library.jar:." Main
    ```

3. Adjust parameters in the `config.json` file to simulate different drug treatment regimens.
